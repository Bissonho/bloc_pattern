The BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern is a pattern created by Google that aims to separate business logic from user interface logic in applications developed with the Flutter framework. It was created to make maintenance and development of applications more scalable and modular.

The main idea of BLoC is to separate business logic into a separate component, called BLoC, which is responsible for managing the state of the application and processing user actions. This approach allows for business logic to be easily tested and reused in other parts of the application.
